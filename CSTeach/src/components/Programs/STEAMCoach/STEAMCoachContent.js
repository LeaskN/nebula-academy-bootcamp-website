Participants will also understand how this is different from traditional learning and traditional teaching and learning environments, learn how to build an understanding of the expectations of such a learning environment and experience, how the role and behavior of students has to change, as well as the role and behavior of the teacher, in order to ensure success. Most importantly, participants will have a visualization of what the classroom has to change into and what it looks like when being done successfully.

Educators will be provided opportunities to gain experience in all aspects of an entrepreneurial experience, and how to engage students in this process within the classroom structure. The content can be approached in several different ways and is easily adaptable to a variety of situations. Each unit contains suggested sample activities, but instructors are provided clear learning topics to allow them the freedom to develop their own exercises. Likewise, sample student objectives are suggested but the instructor has the freedom to create specific objectives to match their own exercises and assignments. </p>
