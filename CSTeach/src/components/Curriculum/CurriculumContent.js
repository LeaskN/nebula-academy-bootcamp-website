Our success together is dependent on understanding the culture, budgets, vision, and teacher capacity. Understanding the vision and what it means to implement Computer Science is an important first step.  Many schools understand how to teach students to use technology and there can be confusion on what it means to implement Computer Science into a school or district.  Computer science calls upon students to understand why and how computing technologies work, and then to build upon that conceptual knowledge by creating computational artifacts. Project based learning with integration of computer science understanding helps to provide building blocks to deeper knowledge and abilities. Providing students the opportunity to problem solve using this knowledge and aligning to real world problems to apply and demonstrate competencies.</p>

This is an effort that may require change in culture, and change in how and what we teach. To ensure its success having a collaborative group of stakeholders ensures the vision is met with perspectives from all groups that will be impacted.

                                                    <p>Teacher training is critical to implementing a successful vision that transforms students and provides them the ability to better understand the evolution of technology and its role in their future.  Teaching computer science requires a different approach from traditional teaching and the first steps to developing teacher capacity is understanding the science behind learning.  We have learned more about the brain in the past 20 years than we have in our lifetime and we still have so much more to learn.  What we do know is that teaching the way we have in the past will not carry us forward into the future.  By helping to support teachers with new cognitive neuroscience understandings that support building growth mindsets, self-awareness, and stronger communication skills we can create greater learning outcomes for our students. We need to teach higher level thinking skills and we first have to ensure our teachers are prepared to teach differently before we begin to teach computer science skills and understanding.</p>

We are asking teachers to teach collaboration skills but we first need to teach teachers how to collaborative themselves.  Building a culture within the administration and the educators where they are able to work collaboratively both digitally and in person supports the needs of a modern workforce. Computer and mathematical occupations are among the fastest-growing and most lucrative sectors in the modern economy and will continue to drive demand from academia to ensure our students are prepared for the growing needs of industry. Setting up a professional learning environment for both the administration and all supporting staff within the school enables the continuous development of our skills so that we can stay aligned with industry not behind. What we teach our students must be what our teachers understand and our administration and staff utilize to ensure we are able to provide real-world understanding of how technology impacts us today and in our future. </p>

                                                    <p>Practice makes perfect, and that requires getting out of our comfort zone to fail and learn from our failures. When we are introducing new concepts and new teaching approaches it is critical that we provide the opportunity for educators to fail and to fail without consequences. If we don't provide that opportunity any professional development will not stick.  It is our nature to turn to what we are comfortable with and to avoid being uncomfortable. Building confidence in new concepts and new ways of doing things takes time to create changed behavior.  Behavior that transforms our gray matter in our brain so that it becomes the norm and reshapes our thinking. Our professional development programs are designed to push educators out of their comfort zone and enable them to fail again and again and to reflect and learn from those failures to build new maps in the brain and to shape new behaviors.  We support educators in and out of the classroom so that they can fail and learn and so that they can see how teaching approaches impact results in the classroom through observation and co-teaching.</p>
