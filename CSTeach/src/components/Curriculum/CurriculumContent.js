This shift requires downstream changes in how and what we teach students to prepare them for the modern workplace. Fewer than half of the schools across the nation are able to offer computer science education to their students. The challenges schools face is the ability to build teacher confidence and capacity in teaching new skills, skills that require a higher level of thinking. Skills that help students think like computer scientists. Learning to code teaches problem solving and critical thinking, and prepares students to better understand how technology can impact businesses and society in positive ways.</p>
