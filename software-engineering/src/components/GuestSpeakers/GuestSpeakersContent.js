                    <p>A <b>Web Application</b> is an application that is stored on a server in the cloud and is delivered over the internet through a web browser interface like Google Chrome. <b>Front-end development</b> manages client-side operations including everything that users visually see in an application. Front-end developers are also responsible for the look and feel of a site. <b>Back-end development</b> manages everything that users donâ€™t see in their browser or application such as databases and server-side operations. A <b>full-stack engineer</b> is an engineer who can handle the front-end and back-end development such as database management, server maintenance, systems engineering, and client-side interfaces.</p>
                    <p>Participants may know where they want to focus from a skills development coming into a program, or have no idea, the program will support the decision process as participants skills evolve. No matter what path they decide to take or develop, all participants will understand both the primary responsibilities of each role and how the roles interact.</p>
                    <h3>AWS Certification:</h3>
                    <p>Our program is unique in that we integrate Amazon Web Services Cloud Practitioner Certification into our program.  We want to ensure our participants can differentiate themselves in applying to jobs post the program. The AWS Cloud Foundations course provides participants with an overall understanding of cloud computing concepts, independent of specific technical roles. It provides participants with a detailed overview of cloud concepts, AWS core services, security, architecture, pricing, and support.</p>

This means that not only do our candidates see what the workforce looks like, but they are given an opportunity to impress the partner right from the start.</p>
