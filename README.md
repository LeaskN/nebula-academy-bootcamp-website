# Nebula-Academy-Web-Design
- Nebula Academy is equipping all learners of all ages with the necessary skills to address the computer science gap. 
- We have four domains, NebulaAcademy.com, code.NebulaAcademy.com, AWS.NebulaAcademy.com, & CSTeach.NebulaAcademy.com.  

To run this application locally do the following:
- run: `git clone https://github.com/LeaskN/nebula-academy-web-design.git`
- Ensure Nodes.js is installed. If it isn't go to this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Install yarn & create-react-app by running `npm i -g create-react-app`
- Ensure you are in either the "software-engineering", "AWS", or "NebulaAcademyHome" directory and run `yarn start`
    - This should take a couple seconds and open a new browser tab with the React App running
- Install npm by running `npm i`
